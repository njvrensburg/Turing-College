As you may have noticed, as you moved through the course, you were getting more freedom in your tasks. The same applies to the Capstone Project. You will do everything on your own, without our guidance. We will only provide you with minimum requirements for this project.\n","\n","\n","The flexibility in this project also allows you to structure it in such a way that it becomes a perfect portfolio item that you can demonstrate to your potential employers. Not only will it be fully unique, but you can also direct the topics into the industries and technologies that you are most interested in.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","As one of the requirements in your final results we will be asking you to provide a written report. Please use the following resources to learn more about structure of written reports:\n","- [Grammarly Guide on how to write report](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-to-write-a-report/)\n","- [The Leeds University report writing guide](https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/14011/writing/114/report_writing)\n","\n","In addition to these resources you are also provided with 2 very basic report examples, just to get a sense of what the final version of your report may look like.\n","\n","- [Report 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rm_JFPxBmmDmy9XtS3bXiTznbmreojAE/view?usp=sharing)\n","- [Report 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/159a6uV9GMo9HQpS0eN1cOb3wrONOpRcN/view?usp=sharing)\n","\n","\n","Find any data source you would like to analyze. By choosing a unique dataset and a unique problem, you will be able to differentiate your project from others when applying to companies. If you have started an endorsement process and have selected job ads/companies, where you would like to work, it is a good practice to choose a dataset from the same industry and do the project as an analyst in the position you would like to be. This will be like freeing two birds with one key - you will prepare for a technical and or job interview and will have a portfolio to show for your future employer. We expect that you analyze it and present this analysis to us with the following expectations: \n","\n","- A quick introduction to the data source\n","- Information about the context of the data (time periods, business context, etc.)\n","- An explanation about the targeted audience\n","- A dashboard, presentation and written report (Please see below for more details)\n","\n","## Your final Results\n","1. Dashboard: The dashboard must be accessible without a special tool. You can choose the data visualization tool, but we encourage you to use Data Studio since sharing it is easier.\n","2. Presentation: Keep your presentation to 10-15 minutes and include extensive speaker notes.\n","3. Written Report: Create a written report of your analysis, in Google Docs. It must contain the necessary data and your insights in written format.\n","\n","## Minimum Requirements\n","1. Utilize at least 3 techniques that you learned in the course. Provide the details of each technique separately. As a rule of thumb, a technique in this context is something that was used as part of a sprint name in the \"Main Analysis Types\" module. Examples - RFM, A/B Testing, Cohort Analysis, etc. You might also want to choose the techniques based on the role that you would ideally want to apply to (product/marketing/payments analyst, etc.).\n","2. Dashboard, presentation and written report must tell a consistent story, be logical and include useful insights.\n","3. You may use the data of your choice, as long as it is not a source we used in the course for Hands-On or Graded Tasks. You should provide the source of your dataset in your report.\n","4. Follow a structured approach. It is not necessary to list the six steps, but have a continuous story, and be able to point out where you covered each step.\n","\n","## General Advice\n","1. One of the most important tasks of a data analyst is finding data. You must find a dataset for this project by yourself. We will not provide one. Good data sources may be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [BigQuery Public Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset&_ga=2.58916586.631541135.1657185065-2065536223.1638469470), [Datasets Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/), etc. If you have problems finding a dataset, do not hesitate to contact JTLs or STLs.\n","2. Choose a subject which you are interested in or are quite familiar with, this will help you with the analysis part and also provide some background information. You can also choose the dataset based on the companies that you are interested in applying to. E.g. if you are interested in working in a company that focuses on health, you might want to consider choosing a dataset that allows you to analyze health data.\n","3. In case you find a very large dataset with many tables, make use of some of the data infrastructure you are familiar with. You can always upload .csv files to BigQuery which is registered to your email account or even create a mini database locally on your machine.\n","4. Use SQL to join and aggregate data. This will make your life much easier without the need to figure out how to join data in different programs you may be using.\n","5. Your presentation and written report must contain these essential parts: the problem you are trying to solve, the hypothesis you will test, a quick overview of the data you used, the analysis, limitations and future recommendations.\n","6. Keep in mind that you will likely use this project as your main portfolio item when applying to jobs â€“ so try to show your best skills!\n","7. Some learners noticed that ~2 months after preparing their capstone project dashboards, they stopped working. This is likely because of Sandbox mode in BigQuery. Please read [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqadrtQbOkbR8ImLMxOOzg0jhInkHLb3dC3VlsEvA54/edit?usp=share_link) which explains how to deal with it.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Rv8_3DPXzkDS"}}]}
