    "- Make sure you are using the Turing College provided account. Even if you logged in with it before, double check the top-right corner user icon by clicking on it and seeing what user is being used. Permissions of multiple accounts someetimes cause issues, so you can try an incognito browser window.\n",
    "- The Turing College provided account is in the format \"username@turingcollege.com\". The password is sent via email\n",
    "- The password in the email is only viable for one-time use. Once logged in, you will be asked to enter a new password. Please remember it, as learners are not able to reset passwords afterwards themselves. In case of losing your password, contact Giedrius Zebrauskas via Discord.\n",
