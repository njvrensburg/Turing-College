        "You are probably becoming more and more aware that you can find data pretty much everywhere. Any time you observe and evaluate something in the world, you are collecting and analyzing data. Your analysis helps you to find easier ways of doing things, to identify patterns, to save your time and to discover surprising new perspectives that can completely change the way you experience things. The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. You will have to apply these six steps in your first practical project. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main goals of this first project. The first one is to get a more intuitive feeling about the mentioned steps of data analysis by trying to do a simple task in practice. The second goal is to learn how the project reviews work in Turing College. You will get to schedule a project review, talk with an STL in a 1-1 call and get personalized feedback from them. Be sure to use this opportunity to ask the STL any questions that you are curious about!\n",

        "## Project requirements:\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Ask\n",
        "Before you start, pick one area of your everyday life you would like to explore further. Think about how many times in the past week you made decisions about anything related to this area. Then, create a list and include details, such as the date, time, cost, quantity, size, etc. Try to focus on things that can be represented by a number or category. \n",
        "Here are a few thought-starters:\n",
        "- Number of cups of coffee/tea/water you drink daily\n",
        "- Number of steps you take daily \n",
        "- Range of emotions you have daily.\n",
        "\n",
        "After you have chosen a topic from your everyday life, you have to decide what problem you want to solve, like: to drink 2 liters of water per day, to drink less than 2 cups of coffee per day, to walk 10 000 steps everyday, to understand moments and reasons why you get upset/angry/confident/happy, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the analysts need to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, in order to determine these things, they ask effective questions, like:\n",
        "- What would initiate me to drink more water/less coffee?\n",
        "- Under which circumstances do I feel confident? What influences this feeling? Environment, time, emotional condition, etc.\n",
        "- What motivates me to be more physically active? What prevents?\n",
        "\n",
        "What questions help to determine if there was a solution for your problem? Write them down and go to the next step.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Prepare\n",
        "During this step, the analysts have to identify what data they need to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step. You can use the structure of this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEqJuzIOwbLW1cLQNLcOGgnBjso6MIe6/edit) to collect your data as a guideline (of course, you can adjust the template to suit your problem). The data collection should not take much of your time, since this is still an introductory exercise instead of a serious analysis. Requirements for data:\n",
        "- Duration for collecting new data: 1-2 days, max - 5 days. Do not waste a lot of time simply waiting for new data to collect and therefore stopping your learning because of it. It can be a very good idea to use already recorded data, like the amount of steps from your personal device - in such case you can have access to many days of data immediately.\n",
        "- Number of observations: min - 10, max - 200.\n",
        "- If you do not want to spend time on data collection, you can use given data: [hourly steps count](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZA2tscQvBMKaRploqugYgszPPK9cZaPSTVh5kPaG00/edit?usp=sharing) for one week and [hourly calories count](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138olJz-UyNu92OIcI_SOEkzaEVinHm3YRxLr3-qB4j0/edit?usp=sharing) for one week.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Process\n",
        "After the data collection, the data analysts have to store and protect the data. During this step, they also clean the data to make sure it is complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data can be aggregated and summarized. Practise mentioned techniques with your collected data. \n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Analyze\n",
        "Then, the analysts do what they do best: analyze!  Let’s use aggregation and a graphical tool to analyze the data and reveal the findings and make some conclusions. You can use Google spreadsheets as a data analyses and a graphical tool. Do not worry about using overly complicated methods just yet (you will have a whole sprint for working with spreadsheets) - instead, try to use what you feel comfortable with already and if you like it, learn about a new technique or two that you feel would be relevant in this analysis. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Share\n",
        "Almost the last step is here! Share your analysis and findings with stakeholders. In this case your stakeholder is Turing College STL. You have to create a report and present it to STL during a project review. \n",
        "\n",
        "Requirements for the presentation:\n",
        "- Duration: around 5 minutes to present your work.\n",
        "- Clear and tidy presentation using a tool of your choice (e.g. MS Powerpoint, a spreadhseet, etc.)\n",
        "- Data analysis steps are combined into a story with conclusion and findings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Act\n",
        "The last step in the data analysis process is to implement changes and take actions. What would you do in your daily life to solve your problem? Expect this question after your presentation.\n",

        "- The six steps of data analyses are followed.\n",
        "- Clearly defined a problem you are trying to solve.\n",
        "- Data analysis is presented as a consistent story.\n",
        "- Analysis, findings and main points are clearly structured.\n",
        "- Google Sheets, visualization are clear and communicate the message/answer.\n",
        "- At least one chart is used in the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sample questions**:\n",
        "- What actions will solve the problem you identified?\n",
